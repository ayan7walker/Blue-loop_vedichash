# Blue-loop_vedichash
The Vedic Hash Preprocessor is a method used to reduce large numeric keys into smaller values before hashing. It applies digit folding based on the Nikhilam Sutra to simplify inputs, improve hashing speed, and reduce memory usage. The system also analyzes hash collisions to evaluate the effectiveness of the reduction logic.

This project implements a Vedic Hash Preprocessor for pre-hash reduction of large numeric keys using digit folding based on the Nikhilam Sutra. The goal is to simplify input values before hashing to improve performance and efficiency. The project includes the reduction logic and an analysis of hash collisions to evaluate the quality and distribution of the reduced values.

Deliverables:

Reduction logic using digit folding (Nikhilam Sutra)

Collision analysis of reduced hash values

Applications:

Hash table preprocessing

Large-number key reduction

Lightweight hashing for edge/embedded systems

If you want, I can also add a How to Run, Algorithm, and Results section for your README.
