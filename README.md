# Blue-loop_vedichash
The Vedic Hash Preprocessor is a method used to reduce large numeric keys into smaller values before hashing. It applies digit folding based on the Nikhilam Sutra to simplify inputs, improve hashing speed, and reduce memory usage. The system also analyzes hash collisions to evaluate the effectiveness of the reduction logic.
